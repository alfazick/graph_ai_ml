# Todo List for Graph Structure Implementation

## Data Processing Tasks
1. [ ] Load and parse the dataset of 50,000 statistics papers
2. [ ] Extract key information from each paper:
   - [ ] Document IDs
   - [ ] Titles
   - [ ] Abstract texts
   - [ ] Category tags

## Graph Building Tasks
1. [ ] Implement first approach for graph construction
   - [ ] Design graph structure
   - [ ] Create adjacency matrix
   - [ ] Serialize to NumPy array

2. [ ] Implement second approach for graph construction
   - [ ] Design alternative graph structure
   - [ ] Create adjacency matrix
   - [ ] Serialize to NumPy array

## Validation Tasks
1. [ ] Verify graph structures are correctly formed
2. [ ] Test serialization/deserialization of NumPy arrays
3. [ ] Document the approaches and implementation details

## Deliverables
- [ ] NumPy array for first graph approach
- [ ] NumPy array for second graph approach
- [ ] Documentation of both approaches
