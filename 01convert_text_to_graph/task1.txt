# Task 1: Building Graph Structures from Statistics Papers

## Objective

The company was provided around 50,000 papers on statistics. Each paper is identified by:
- Document ID
- Title
- Abstract text
- One or more category tags (from a predefined set)

## First Milestone

We will implement two different approaches to build graphical structures from the paper dataset. The deliverables will include:
- Serialized NumPy arrays
- Adjacency matrices for graphs built using both approaches

## Project Importance

The project's overall goals are to:
1. Derive actionable intelligence from the statistics papers dataset
2. Identify the most influential papers
3. Group papers into high-level communities or clusters

This first milestone demonstrates two different approaches to building graphs that will enable this analysis, serving as an essential foundation for the entire project.
